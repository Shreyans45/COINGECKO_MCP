# COINGECKO_MCP

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a Crypto Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server using the CoinGecko API.
It provides a unified interface for multiple cryptocurrency data operations â€” all accessible via a single /mcp endpoint that accepts JSON-based requests.

The system is built using Flask (Python), and runs completely inside Google Colab with background threading to prevent blocking.
It demonstrates API integration, modular design, error handling, and basic test coverage
